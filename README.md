**Abstract**

The primary goal of this field experiment was to assess how traffic signals at intersections influence the safety and mobility of older pedestrians, with a specific focus on the intersection between Amsterdam Avenue and 106th Street in New York City. We aimed to identify critical areas where intersection safety can be improved through better traffic signal management and infrastructure modifications. Our methodology involved a combination of quantitative data collection through traffic counts and qualitative data collection via surveys targeted at older pedestrians. Traffic counts were conducted at the mentioned intersection during peak hours to understand traffic flow dynamics, while surveys were distributed to older pedestrians to gather insights on their experiences and safety perceptions at this intersection.

## Problem Statement

### Objective

This study aims to evaluate the impact of traffic signal operations on the safety and mobility of older pedestrians at urban intersections. This demographic often faces unique challenges that can significantly impair their ability to navigate city streets safely [2].

### Introduction to Pedestrian Safety

Pedestrian safety is a critical public health issue, especially in urban areas with congested intersections where pedestrians and vehicles interact frequently. While all pedestrians face some risk, older adults are particularly vulnerable due to physiological, sensory, and cognitive changes associated with aging [2].

### Challenges Faced by Older Pedestrians

Older pedestrians typically move at slower walking speeds and require more time to cross streets. They may also have impaired vision or hearing, making it difficult to respond to conventional traffic cues. Additionally, their increased vulnerability to serious injuries in the event of an accident makes understanding and improving their interaction with traffic systems of great importance. These challenges include:

* Older pedestrians may not be able to cross intersections within the time allocated by standard traffic signals [4].
* Reduced hearing and vision complicate their ability to navigate safely, especially where auditory or visual signals are not adequately tailored to their needs [3].
* The physical frailty of older adults means that accidents at intersections are more likely to result in severe injuries or fatalities for this group [1].

### Significance of Optimizing Traffic Signals

Optimizing traffic signals to accommodate the needs of older pedestrians is not just about improving their safety and mobility; it's also about enhancing the overall inclusivity and accessibility of urban environments. Effective traffic signal management can:

* Reduce the incidence of pedestrian-related accidents.
* Encourage more older adults to engage in healthy, active transportation.
* Increase the overall quality of life by promoting safer community environments.

### Approach

This study begins with a broad examination of pedestrian safety issues and then narrows down to focus specifically on older pedestrians. We will investigate how current traffic signal configurations at various intersections either support or hinder their mobility and safety, and propose targeted adjustments aimed at creating more age-friendly urban spaces.

## Data Description

### Quantitative Traffic Counts

#### Methodology

On April 24th, between 4:00 and 5:00 PM, a comprehensive observational study was conducted at the intersection of 106th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. The aim was to capture a detailed depiction of traffic behavior and pedestrian activity within this urban setting. The study employed video recording from two distinct points to ensure comprehensive coverage of the entire intersection.

During the initial one-hour period from 4:00 to 5:00 PM, video footage was systematically collected to document the dynamic interactions among vehicles, cyclists (including ebikes and scooters), and pedestrians. This footage served as the basis for later analysis of traffic patterns and pedestrian behaviors. Special attention was given to capturing activity in all eight available directions: North-East, North-West, North-South, West-South, West-East, East-North, East-South, and East-West.

To ensure a comprehensive understanding of traffic volume and pedestrian activity, data collection occurred at five-minute intervals throughout the study period. This approach facilitated the accurate recording of the number of vehicles, cyclists, pedestrians, and specifically, older pedestrians traversing the intersection.

#### Traffic Volume and Pedestrian Activity Data

Overall, the data shows a clear pattern of traffic flow with vehicles dominating the roads, particularly in the North-South direction (see Table 1). Pedestrian activity is also significant in certain directions, while cyclists, including those on ebikes and scooters, contribute minimally to the traffic in 4:00 to 5:00 PM (see Table 2).

For vehicles, the data indicates a pronounced movement predominantly in the North-South direction, which consistently registers the highest counts throughout the hour. There is also considerable traffic in the East-West and West-East directions, though these numbers are significantly lower than those in the North-South direction. Other directions, such as North-East and North-West, along with minor routes like East-North and East-South,
